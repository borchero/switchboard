This directory contains the Helm chart as well as detailed instructions for deploying the
Switchboard Kubernetes operator. Please read through this repository's root README to understand
how Switchboard works.

## Installation

### Prerequisities

Since Switchboard processes Traefik CRDs, you must make sure that your Kubernetes cluster has all
[Traefik v2](https://github.com/traefik/traefik) CRDs installed.

Depending on the integrations that you want to enable, you further need to have the following
components installed:

- **cert-manager integration**: Requires [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io) and its CRDs to be
  installed. Can optionally be done by setting `cert-manager.install = true` in this chart.
- **external-dns integration**: Requires
  [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) along with its `DNSEndpoint` CRD
  installed. Can optionally be done by setting `external-dns.install = true` in this chart.

### Install

Switchboard can be installed with Helm version `>= 3.7.0`. For Helm version `< 3.8.0`, you need to
set `HELM_EXPERIMENTAL_OCI=1`. Then you can install the chart directly with the following command:

```bash
helm install switchboard oci://ghcr.io/borchero/charts/switchboard
```

By default, this installs Switchboard with no integrations enabled, i.e. it will not create any
resources. Integrations can be enabled by setting `integrations.<name>.enabled` to `true`. Consult
the configuration options to check which integrations you want to enable.

_Note: You can check your Helm version via `helm version`._

## Values

The following lists all values that may be set when installing this chart (see
[`values.yaml`](./values.yaml) for a more structured overview):

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| affinity | object | `{}` |  |
| cert-manager.install | bool | `false` | Whether the cert-manager chart should be installed.    See: https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/cert-manager/cert-manager |
| cert-manager.installCRDs | bool | `true` |  |
| certificateIssuer.create | bool | `false` | Whether an ACME certificate issuer should be created for use with cert-manager. |
| certificateIssuer.email | string | `nil` |  |
| certificateIssuer.solvers | list | `[]` | The solvers to use for verifying that the domain is owned in the ACME challenge.    See: https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/ |
| external-dns.crd.create | bool | `true` |  |
| external-dns.install | bool | `false` | Whether the external-dns chart should be installed. If installed manually, make sure to add    the `crd` item to the sources.    See: https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/external-dns/external-dns |
| external-dns.sources[0] | string | `"crd"` |  |
| external-dns.sources[1] | string | `"service"` |  |
| external-dns.sources[2] | string | `"ingress"` |  |
| image.name | string | `"ghcr.io/borchero/switchboard"` | The switchboard image to use. |
| image.tag | string | `nil` | The switchboard image tag to use. If not provided, assumes the same version as the chart. |
| integrations.certManager.certificateTemplate | object | `{}` | The certificate template to use when creating certificates via the cert-manager    integration. Unless `certificateIssuer.create` is set to `true` when installing this    chart, setting `.spec.IssuerRef` is required. |
| integrations.certManager.enabled | bool | `false` | Whether the cert-manager integration should be enabled. If enabled, `Certificate`    resources are created by Switchboard. Setting this to `true` requires specifying an issuer    via `integrations.certManager.issuer` or letting the chart create its own issuer by    setting `certificateIssuer.create = true` and specifying additional properties for the    certificate issuer. |
| integrations.externalDNS.enabled | bool | `false` | Whether the external-dns integration should be enabled. If enabled `DNSEndpoint` resources    are created by Switchboard. Setting this to `true` requires specifying the target via    `integrations.externalDNS.target`. |
| integrations.externalDNS.targetIPs | list | `[]` | The static IP addresses that created DNS records should point to. Must not be provided    if the target service is set. |
| integrations.externalDNS.targetService.name | string | `nil` | The name of the (Traefik) service whose IP address should be used for DNS records. |
| integrations.externalDNS.targetService.namespace | string | `nil` | The namespace of the (Traefik) service whose IP address should be used for DNS records. |
| metrics.enabled | bool | `true` | Whether the metrics endpoint should be enabled. |
| metrics.port | int | `9090` | The port on which Prometheus metrics can be scraped on path `/metrics`. |
| nodeSelector | object | `{}` |  |
| podAnnotations | object | `{}` | Annotations to set on the switchboard pod. |
| podMonitor.create | bool | `false` | Whether a PodMonitor should be created which can be used to scrape the metrics endpoint. Ignored if `metrics.enabled` is set to `false` |
| podMonitor.namespace | string | `nil` | The namespace where the monitor should be created in. Defaults to the release namespace. |
| replicas | int | `1` | The number of manager replicas to use. |
| resources | object | `{}` | The resources to use for the operator. |
| selector.ingressClass | string | `nil` | When set, Switchboard only processes ingress routes with the `kubernetes.io/ingress.class`    annotation set to this value. |
| tolerations | list | `[]` |  |
